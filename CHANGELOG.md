# Changelog

All notable changes to Orchestra will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Warm agent pool — pre-spawn Claude/Codex agents for near-instant session startup
- Agent session aliases — decouple display session IDs from process session IDs so warm agents can be claimed without visible ID changes
- Terminal query responder — synthetic DA1/DA2/DSR/OSC replies so TUI apps bootstrap correctly before a real PTY attaches
- Webhook management UI in AddActionDialog — enable/disable webhooks, generate tokens, configure filters, and copy webhook URLs inline
- Sidebar agent response sanitizer — strip box-drawing, junk lines, and terminal artifacts from sidebar previews
- Garbled-text detection in idle notifications — skip summarization for mangled prompts

### Changed
- Removed WebGL addon from terminal renderer — fall back to canvas for broader compatibility
- Broadened terminal response stripping regex to catch OSC color reports, focus events, and cursor position replies
- Codex rollout parser now handles array-of-content-blocks responses (output_text items)
- Idle notifier shows short prompts verbatim instead of calling the summarizer
- Idle notifier detects requiresUserInput from agent response even when no user prompt is available
- Worktree deletion now always removes from store on force-delete, even if disk cleanup fails
- Terminal cursor uses block style when inactive with proper cursorAccent color
- Warm shell pool adds exponential backoff on spawn failures to prevent respawn storms

### Fixed
- Worktree force-delete no longer shows an error alert when the user explicitly chose "Delete Anyway"
